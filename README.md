## Concept

This template is meant to serve as a foundation for every P2/P3 following the React-Express-MySQL stack, as learned in Wild Code School.
We used this template for our final project where our client was the Wild Code School.

The objective of this application is to allow the wild code school to share the masterclasses that have been done with their partner companies. The school offers a large choice of videos and fields to discover.

## Setup & Use

- `npx prisma migrate dev` : Update the database (go to "cd backend" before doing the command)
- copy and paste the ".env.sample" documents (both in the front and back) and remove the ".sample" extension before changing the content accordingly.

### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm run setup`
- _NB: To launch the backend server, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `backend/.env.sample`_

### Available Commands

- `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server
- `lint` : Runs validation tools, and refuses unclean code (will be executed on every _commit_)
- `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)
